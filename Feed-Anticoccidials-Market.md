Anticoccidials are essential for preventing and controlling coccidiosis in poultry, which remains one of the most common diseases in intensive farming systems. The growth in global meat consumption, coupled with the rising awareness of animal health and disease management, is driving the market's expansion. Additionally, advancements in veterinary pharmaceuticals and growing concerns over the use of antibiotics are pushing the industry towards more targeted and sustainable solutions, further stimulating the market for anticoccidials.</p> <p><strong></strong></p> <p>As poultry farming continues to evolve, the demand for effective anticoccidial products, particularly those that are organic or non-antibiotic in nature, is increasing.
